			<h2 class="faq__index-title">Answers:</h2>

			<p id="what-is-a-doula" class="faq__body-question"><b>What is a doula?</b></p>

			<p>As a doula, my job is often referred to as "mothering the mother". I provide physical, emotional, and educational support for a birthing woman and her family during the perinatal stages. We'll work together prenatally, during labor and birth, as well as planning for and transitioning into the fourth trimester.</p>

			<p id="my-partner-will-be" class="faq__body-question"><b>My partner will be with me the whole time. Would we benefit from a doula?</b></p>

			<p>You may have heard of the term 'birth team' - A birth team works together to care for a mother and her needs during the exhausting journey of labor. As a doula, I'm trained in ways to comfort a birthing woman, and naturally encourage the descent of your baby. Because your partner knows you best, we work together as a team to support your physical and emotional needs. I'll provide support in the way that best fits your family's needs - whether your partner chooses to fully be hands-on, or prefers to offer moral and emotional support, I will conform to your dynamic.</p>

			<p id="do-you-offer-support" class="faq__body-question"><b>Do you offer support if I give birth at a hospital?</b></p>

			<p>I'd love to support you and your unique birth in <i>any</i> setting. As January Harshe states, "I do not care what kind of birth you have... a homebirth, scheduled cesarean, epidural hospital birth, or if you birth alone in the woods next to baby deer. I care that you had options, that you were supported in your choices, and that you were respected."</p>

			<p id="what-hospitals" class="faq__body-question"><b>What hospitals are you familiar with?</b></p>

			<p>St. David's North Austin Medical Center (Women's Center of Texas) and Seton Main are the two most common hospitals my clients have chosen to deliver at. I've also supported families at Seton Hays, Baylor Scott & White, St. David's South, and St. David's Round Rock. I'm eager to explore different hospitals and have even traveled across the country to support a birth on the East Coast - so I'd love to hear about the hospital you chose!</p>

			<p id="do-you-serve" class="faq__body-question"><b>Do you serve clients outside of Austin, TX?</b></p>

			<p>I serve clients in Austin and it's surrounding areas - as far North as Round Rock and Cedar Park, and as far South as Kyle, TX. However, special cases do apply, so don't be afraid to ask. <a class="faq__link" href="doula.html#contact">Contact me</a> for more information!</p>

			<p id="do-you-support" class="faq__body-question"><b>Do you support cesarean births?</b></p>

			<p>Absolutely. A cesarean birth can be frightening, especially if you weren't originally planning for one. If allowed by your care provider, I will stay by your side throughout the entire procedure. Too often, mothers feel separated from the experience of a cesarean birth; I'll make sure you're included in the experience and informed of each step of the birth of your baby, while respecting your comfort level. </p>


			<p id="do-you-support-vbac" class="faq__body-question"><b>Do you support VBAC births?</b></p>

			<p>Yes! I'm a strong advocate for VBAC births; the National Institutes of Health says that "VBAC is a safe and reasonable option for most women, and that most women (74%) who attempt a VBAC will have a vaginal birth" (<a class="faq__link" href="https://evidencebasedbirth.com/topfive/">Source</a>). So if a VBAC is something you're interested in, let's work together to achieve that goal with your supportive provider!</p>


			<p id="what-training-and" class="faq__body-question"><b>What training and experience do you have?</b></p>

			<p>I completed doula training through DONA International in June of 2016 and immediately started supporting births. A few months later, I began volunteering for GALS (Giving Austin Labor Support) as a dispatch operator and birth doula for under-supported women in Austin. Exactly a year later I earned my Prenatal Yoga Teacher Certificate through Yoga Yoga, and in February 2018, I completed birth & bereavement doula training through Stillbirthday. I have many plans to expand my expertise and continue contributing to the birthing community in Austin!</p>

			<p id="do-you-recommend" class="faq__body-question"><b>Do you recommend placenta encapsulation?</b></p>

			<p>There's anecdotal evidence (from all across the web) that suggests placenta encapsulation increases milk supply, while improving mood and energy levels. Some of my clients swear by it, and others say that they didn't notice a difference. To my understanding, not much research has been done on placenta consumption - this is really unfortunate. Evidence Based Birth recently published <a class="faq__link" href="https://evidencebasedbirth.com/evidence-on-placenta-encapsulation/">a Q&A video</a> that covers some related studies on placenta consumption. If you do choose to encapsulate, I'd love to share my recommendations on local encapsulators!</p>

			<p id="ive-looked-through" class="faq__body-question"><b>I've looked through your site. Now what's the next step?</b></p>

			<p>If you like what you've seen so far, or simply have more questions, <a class="faq__link" href="doula.html#contact">please reach out</a>! I'll get back to you within 24 hours (usually within 2 hours), and at that time we can set up a date to meet in person or talk more over the phone. These are both opportunities (free of charge) to get a feel for each other to determine if I'd be a good addition to your birth team.</p>
