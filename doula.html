				<h2 class="section-title">about</h2>
				<p class="about__content">I started my doula journey when I moved to Austin in July of 2016. Before that, I taught first grade in Maryland where I had a rewarding and stable job, but always found myself listening to birth podcasts and following birth vlogs for fun. In many of those stories, I kept hearing this 'do-lah' word. A little bit of research taught me that these doulas are trained birth coaches, empowering Moms and their partners to write their own birth story. That's what I wanted to do with my life! I immediately registered to begin my doula certification and haven't looked back since.</p>

Although I went into labor full of confidence, there came a point when my labor stalled out and I didn't know if I could go on anymore. Becky stayed by my side and provided the calm, nurturing presence that I needed to regain my focus. She gave me the mental, emotional and even physical support that I needed to be able to complete the 23 hours of labor and bring my son into the world."<br><span class="testimonial__name">- Sarah</span></p>

				<p class="testimonial__text">"Throughout my pregnancy, my husband and I couldn't decide if we really needed a Doula but we set up two interviews and one of them was with Becky. I was so impressed with how prepared she was for all my questions and concerns. You could tell she has a strong passion to support all kinds of labor so we decided to take the plunge and hire her as our Doula. We are so happy that we did! Leading up to my delivery Becky was always available to text random and sometimes TMI questions too! When my little girl decided to come a  week early, Becky's quick response to our many texts and calls was priceless! Becky came over in the early hours of the morning to help me labor at home, accompanied us to the hospital and stayed with us well after little Ellie was born! Becky was so calm and collected during my labor and provided me and my husband with different ways to make it through each contraction. When my labor stalled and our baby wasn't descending she gave me objective advice to take the epidural. Once our baby girl was born, she was taken to the NICU and Becky stayed by my side so I wouldn't be alone while my husband was with our little girl. Becky's number one priority is to support the mama and I definitely felt that with her. She was knowledgeable and confident in her skills and provided my husband and our little girl all the support we needed!"<br><span class="testimonial__name">- Tania</span></p>

				<p class="testimonial__text">"Becky was the perfect addition to our labor and delivery story. Due to medical reasons, I had to be induced. If it resulted in a c-section, I was concerned how my doula would be involved, and I'm here to tell you the emotional support before my unplanned c-section was priceless. As a first time mom, my labor/delivery lasted over a day (even with drugs to speed things along), and Becky was there every step of the way. During all the hours of labor (prior to the delivery), Becky provided guidance when nurses came in recommending this or that. Becky told me (and it was true) that she was my advocate and reminder that I had options when drugs or deviations from my birth plan were suggested. As she has a good deal of experience, she also told us how the day would go which my husband and I appreciated, being first time parents. More than anything I wanted things explained prior to them occurring. I relayed this to the nurses, but Becky really helped ease anxiety and emotions the day of when nurses failed to explain procedures. She also took pictures as my husband and I were in the moment and preoccupied with the experience. I cannot recommend her enough. A doula was a great investment for us, but more than that, Becky was personable, reliable, accessible and a wonderful resource (emotionally and physically) on the day our little one joined this world."<br><span class="testimonial__name">- Monica</span></p>

						<span class="faq__letter">Q:</span>
						<span class="faq__question">What is a doula?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">As a doula, my job is often referred to as "mothering the mother". I provide physical, emotional, and educational support for a birthing woman before and during labor, as well as postpartum.</span>
					</faq>
				</div>


				<div class="faq__qa">
					<div class="faq__q">
						<span class="faq__letter">Q:</span>
						<span class="faq__question">My partner will be with me the whole time. Would we benefit from a doula?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">You may have heard of the term 'birth team'; A birth team works together to care for a mother and her needs during the exhausting journey of labor. As a doula, I am trained in ways to comfort a birthing woman, and naturally encourage descent of your baby. Because your partner knows you best, we will work together to support your physical and emotional needs. I will deliver my support in the way that best fits your family's needs - whether your partner chooses to fully be hands-on, or prefers to offer moral and emotional support, I will conform to your dynamic.</span>
					</faq>

				<div class="faq__qa">
					<div class="faq__q">
						<span class="faq__letter">Q:</span>
						<span class="faq__question">Does a doula provide support during cesarean births?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">Absolutely! A cesarean birth can be frightening, especially if you weren't originally planning for one. If allowed by your care provider, I will be by your side throughout the entire procedure! Too often, mothers feel separated from the experience of a cesarean birth; but with a doula, you are not alone! I will make sure you're included in the experience and are informed of each step of the birth of your baby, with sensitivity to your comfort level during the process. I will assist you in holding and meeting your new baby as your care provider finishes the cesarean procedure. I can also take pictures the moment you and your spouse meet your baby for the first time, if you would like. In the case that your baby has to be relocated, I will continue to stay by your side, while your partner follows your baby, so neither of you are alone. If you're having a cesarean birth, we can discuss your wishes and the options of a family centered cesarean at your birth location!</span>

					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">Of course! I will support you and your unique birth in any setting. As January Harshe states, "I do not care what kind of birth you have... a homebirth, scheduled cesarean, epidural hospital birth, or if you birth alone in the woods next to baby deer. I care that you had options, that you were supported in your choices, and that you were respected".</span>

						<span class="faq__question">How does a doula differ from a midwife?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">A midwife performs clinical and medical tasks, whereas a doula coaches you through labor and birth. As a doula, I do not perform vaginal exams, administer medication, or provide medical diagnosis or advice. However, I will be by your side at all times, whereas a midwife may not be able to be fully present until the later stages of labor.</span>

						<span class="faq__question">What training and experience do you have?</span>
					</div>
					<faq class="faq__a">
						<span class="faq__letter">A:</span>
						<span class="faq__answer">I began my birth doula certification through DONA International in June 2016. This comprehensive training involves a 12-hour childbirth class, 3-hour breastfeeding course, 16-hour birth doula workshop, and hands-on experience as a birth doula for a minimum of 3 births. Exceptional evaluations from the mother herself, and her care provider are required, along with proof of extensive reading on pregnancy, labor support, breastfeeding, and postpartum mood disorders. While pursuing my certification, I continue to seek opportunities to learn and gain experience in the birth world. I began volunteering for GALS (Giving Austin Labor Support) in September 2016 as a birth doula and dispatch operator. I also enjoy attending community birth events and workshops to be able to share my experiences with Mamas. A few of my favorites include use of essential oils and placenta encapsulation!</span>
